** Inject parent component into child component

The stated way of Hierarchical Injection is no longer valid. Most web resources
are about =@Parent= decorator (I have not found the relevant commit for the
removal of =@Parent=, but I assume it's done in unifying the data flow
direction.)

According to the =src/core/metadata.ts::Query=, it's better to have parent
components query all its children.
