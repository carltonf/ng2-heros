* Angular2 Pitfalls

** =@Component::moduleId=

set this to use relative paths for component assets.

** Silent failures
When it fails silents, usually it's related to the DOM, here I list some cases
I've come over.

- Pay close attention to inputs/outputs spelling

* Make tabs an independent module for reuse

An npm module preferred. Most web resources are outdated.

** A warning on local module testing
  
It's tempting to have =tabs= install from a local directory. But there are some
issues associated. Suggestion [[https://github.com/timoxley/linklocal][timoxley/linklocal]].

- Be aware of [[https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/7426][Update of local dependencies does not work]]
  
  This issue has been around for quite a while.

- =npm link= is ok, but it doesn't look up your =package.json= file.

  which [[https://github.com/timoxley/linklocal][timoxley/linklocal]] addresses well.

** About the =package.json= and =tsconfig.json=

=tsconfig.json= is always needed. Refer to =ng2-heroes= for a sample.

In package.json, there is the =typings= field to set. Refer to [[https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages][Typings for npm
packages Â· Microsoft/TypeScript Wiki]] for details.

* Some Notes
** =lite-server=

- Avoid opening a new browser window

  There is an ongoing [[https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server/issues/1][issue]] about exposing =browser-sync='s configuration
  objects in command line.
  
  For now, add =open: false= to =sync.init= in =lite-server.js=.

*** *TODO* Use our own server

=lite-server= doesn't really have any fancy features, use our own!
=browser-sync= looks quite interesting though (so we don't need our custom SSE).
